# MealMate
This repo is used to build a pipeline for facilitating food shopping in grocery scenarios.
Three agents are integrated in our framework:
* Chef de cuisine: generate recipe(i.e. ingredients and instructions) for the desired dish
* Line cook: Check stock in database and make substitutions based on the recipe generated by chef de cuisine
* Recommender: Propose recommendations for substitution, dish, and store based on customer preference.
